DESCRIPTION

This is a simple static web application built using the gatsby React framework. It was designed as a personal-use site for my dad, so that he could view his record collection online at any time. 

The main benefit of hosting the list online is so that he can easily navigate through and view all of the album covers and have a better view of his collection. (I may also refer to it when coming up with holiday and birthday gift ideas). 

Developing this simple web application also allowed me to practice working with React and gatsby, and further improve my CSS and JavaScript skills.
